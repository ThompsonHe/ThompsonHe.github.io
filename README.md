## Welcome to ThompsonHe's HomePage

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ThompsonHe/ThompsonHe.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I am now a postgraduate student of College of Software, Beihang University(BUAA), Beijing, China, under the supervision of [Prof.Lv Sheng](https://lucassheng.github.io/). My research interests include computer vision and video processing, especially deep learning 3D vision problems.y

### Jekyll Themes
